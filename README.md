# TARGER: Neural Argument Mining at Your Fingertips

This page contains code of the Web application and web service based on the neural [argument tagger](http://github.com/achernodub/bilstm-cnn-crf-tagger). The figure below illustrates how the sytem looks like: you can enter some text in the input box and detect arguments in it with one of the pre-trained neural models for argument mining.

Below you will find some instructions on how to run TARGER web application and its API locally (using docker). Alternatively you can just (access it online)[http://ltdemos.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/targer/] though web interface or using API. This web application relies on a (neural tagging library)[http://github.com/achernodub/targer] based on (PyTorch)[https://pytorch.org] framework. You may find this library also useful on its own i.e. for training sequence taggers for argument mining, but also for other tasks such as part of speech tagging or named entity recognition. The library is taking as input CoNLL files is easy to use and has a minimal number of dependencies. Note tht while this library lives in a separate repository from the web applcation but is also part of the TARGER project. So if you are using the library, please also cite the paper mentioned above. For documentation about the tagging library refer to (its repository)[http://github.com/achernodub/targer].  

## Quick run web application with docker
`docker-compose up`
Access the frontend at http://localhost:6001/ and the backend REST API at http://localhost:6000.
